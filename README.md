You can add your music also! Just put notelist (sheet) in music folder. You can find some in Internet, compose yourself or create from MIDI file using https://specy.github.io/skyMusic/

Possible problems: 
 - Sometimes Windows antivirus may think that my program is a Trojan. It's not :0 . You can look at source codes in the special folder. To fix that you can mark my program like OK in the Windows settings or turn off antivirus
 - Sometimes my program may work badly: skipping some notes, lagging and other. Try to close other running programs on your PC or restart it. It should help.
 - Unfortunately, other players may not hear melody as good as you. Its problem on Sky: Cotl servers side. Slow melody is going good, fast may be a problem, game do not like pressing lots of notes in short time. Also Internet connection on both sides may influence here

Peace!
